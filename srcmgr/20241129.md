# 20241129 srcmgr meeting

Attendees: markj, emaste, imp

- A bit time-constrained today since it's US Thanksgiving
- Took in grehan@'s bit for safekeeping
- Discussed a bug triage session
  - linimon@ has been closing many old bugs that have some commit associated with them
  - sometimes this is incorrect, e.g., when a bug is opened for a test failure and we reference the bug in a commit which skips the test for CI
  - mused having a "Fixes PR:" tag to make it easier to understand the relationship between the commit and the PR
  - not sure we want to impose extra process; we might also confuse github in the future since "PR" is overloaded
- Going to host a src bug triage session on Friday Dec 6, 11am-2pm EST
  - markj to send out a notification to developers@ on monday or tuesday
  - emaste will help set up zoom
- Spent some time going through open PRs on github
  - imp landed a whole bunch
