# 2021-10-03 Graphics Team Meeting Notes

Attendeeds: Tobias Berner (tcberner@), Warner Losh (bsdimp@), Adriaan de Groot (adridg@), Kevin Bowling

- libinput: KDE upstream would like 1.19.x for the upcoming release -- port is still at 1.16.4.
    - adridg@ will create a PR, and set "Maintainer Feedback?" flag 
    - seems to be no reason for the holdback on 1.16
    - Fails in patching when bumped to 1.19.x (problem is in shebang files, adridg@ on it)
- fontconfig is still on the todo for adridg@
- xorg-server update is still on the todo of tcberner@
- kde now uses gitlab CI, more FreeBSD systems in KDE upstream (now FreeBSD 13, previously 12)
- Wayland not working in 13 and 14
    - adridg@ will take look at it
- PR to make dbus optional
    - Very foot shooty
    - Having the option is fine, so long as it doesn't break other ports
- Bindary nvidia driver - kbowling
    - Suspend / resume working with it
    - Suspends fine, resume fails with ACPI error (card not back in D0 state)
    - Hooks for all this in sources we have for binary driver
