# 2021-08-23 Graphics Team Meeting Notes

Attendees: Tobias Berner (tcberner@), Warner Losh (bsdimp@)

- **TO DISCUSS**: how to monitor directories effectively
  - opening all files in ~ can be too much
  - a better monitoring solution for files is required that does not need opening individual files
  - also blocked umounting (maybe solved by using O_PATH)
- Steps to take: open PR for kqueue/kevent 
    - [PR 258010](https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=258010)
    - probably foundation should get involved and found development (read: pay kib to do it)
