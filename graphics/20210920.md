# 2021-09-20 Graphics Team Meeting Notes
Attendees: Tobias Berner (tcberner@), Niclas Zeising (zeising@), Warner Losh (bsdimp@), Adriaan de Groot (adridg@)

- Pulseaudio and Pipewire is what's interesting now
  - Pulseaudio is working and bugs closed
  - Pipewire isn't working quite right with with chrome (www/qt5-webengine requires libpipewire-0.20, we have 0.3x in ports)
  - Developed with Wayland in mind (need pipewire to do screen sharing, etc)
  - KDE wants a newer pipewire than chromium wants
  - Version updates are in progress (need two versions: one for KDE and one for webengine)
  - Chromium needs / wants newest pipewire (unsure if this means not enabled or silently bundled)
- X11 PRs
    - libwacom building with llvm13: it's doing weird things
    - Minor updates
    - wayland updates in progress (assigned to portmgr)
        - Waiting for exp run to finish
    - wayland protocol update fine
    - complaint that pure UEFI mode isn't working with xorg. Likely a documentation bug.
    - Another one that's a known issue
    - Need to have a PR scrub and maybe a bug-a-thon to fix the known issues and/or document known problems.
- Desktop PRs
    - fontconfig is next up for Adriaan
    - Need hook into the pkg triggers for running the pkg trigger script when we install a font.
    - Waiting on pkg triggers to be allowed into tree
