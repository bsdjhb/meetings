- Welcome
- Discuss shifts in how we're doing things
  - Recording this meeting
  - Rotating schedule to mix groups
      - 1800 UTC -> 2200 UTC -> 0300 UTC
      - View meetings as every 3rd week, with the 2200 time slot for exchange. Can tweak the times a little since overlap needed is smaller.
  - Move some things to email / shared docs
  - Try to break items down into actionable actions
